It&#8217;s the first thing potential clients will see, so it&#8217;s important to make sure it&#8217;s polished and professional. Here are five things you should never do in your web developer portfolio:<\/p>\n\n\n<ol style=\"\" class=\"wp-block-list \">\n<li>\n<strong>Include outdated or irrelevant projects.<\/strong>&nbsp;If you have projects in your portfolio that are outdated or irrelevant to the work you&#8217;re currently doing, it&#8217;s best to remove them. This will help you focus on your best work and make your portfolio more relevant to potential clients.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n<strong>Use poor-quality images or videos.<\/strong>&nbsp;Your portfolio should showcase your best work, so it&#8217;s important to use high-quality images and videos. If your images are blurry or your videos are choppy, it will reflect poorly on your skills as a web developer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n<strong>Have a cluttered or disorganized portfolio.<\/strong>&nbsp;Your portfolio should be easy to navigate and understand. If it&#8217;s cluttered or disorganized, potential clients will be less likely to take the time to look through it.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n<strong>Include projects that you didn&#8217;t create yourself.<\/strong>&nbsp;If you&#8217;re including projects in your portfolio that you didn&#8217;t create yourself, be sure to give credit to the original creator. This will show that you&#8217;re honest and ethical, and it will also help you avoid any copyright infringement issues.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n<strong>Make false or misleading claims.<\/strong>&nbsp;Don&#8217;t claim to have skills or experience that you don&#8217;t have. If potential clients find out that you&#8217;ve lied to them, they&#8217;re likely to lose trust in you and your work.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph \">By following these tips, you can create a web developer portfolio that will impress potential clients and help you land your dream job.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading wp-block-heading\" id=\"additional-tips\">Additional Tips<\/h2>\n\n\n<ul style=\"\" class=\"wp-block-list \">\n<li>\n<strong>Keep your portfolio updated.<\/strong>&nbsp;As you create new projects, be sure to update your portfolio to include them. This will show potential clients that you&#8217;re constantly learning and growing as a web developer.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n<strong>Get feedback from others.<\/strong>&nbsp;Ask friends, family, or colleagues to review your portfolio and give you feedback. This will help you identify any areas that need improvement.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n<strong>Use a professional design.<\/strong>&nbsp;Your portfolio should have a professional design that reflects your skills and experience. Use a clean and simple layout, and use high-quality images and videos.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\n<strong>Promote your portfolio.<\/strong>&nbsp;Once you&#8217;re happy with your portfolio, be sure to promote it online and offline. Share it on social media, submit it to online portfolio directories, and include it on your resume and website.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph \">By following these tips, you can create a web developer portfolio that will help you land your dream job.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your portfolio is your calling card as a web developer.
